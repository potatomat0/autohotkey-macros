# why
my wireless mouse broke, my touchpad's right click also broke, my stupid lenovo laptop isnt compatible with the touchpad driver that allows me to two finger tap to double click, and so i use **autohotkey** macro scripting to allow me to right click by pressing the right alt button and other cool stuffs including:
1. vim movements when pressing left alt + h/j/k/l
2. switch capslock with esc since i use esc more often
3. Copy to clipboard the HEX color of the pixel under cursor using CTRL+Win+LeftClick
4. hotstrings to write current system's time and date
5. i also have a text file that contains macros for vietnamese telex since it's easier to write macros for vietnamese in unikey
